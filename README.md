## Get your data loaded
This library allows you to spin up an ETL process without you having to think too much on it so you can get to 
more important things like analyzing your data or fortnite 


## Where we load things?
By default we setup a Postgres docker container and transform targetting this database


## Installation
COMING SOON!

But will look something like this

```bash
pip install simpletl
```

## Formats that work
[X] - CSV
[] - JSON -- In Progress Now!
[] - XML (eww)
[] - Excel -- This will be interesting

## Integrations with SIMPETL

1. Jupyter Notebook Integration [] What does this mean? My idea is simple. Lets spawn an 
ETL process that after the loading has been done we then spawn a Jupyter Notebook with the 
dataframe already loaded inside and maybe a couple operations loaded into the notebook.
