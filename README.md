Y does this look like crapp....?


## Get your data loaded
This library allows you to spin up an ETL process without you having to think too much on it so you can get to 
more important things like analyzing your data or fortnite 


## Installation
## Virtual Env
`python -m venv env`
`source venv/bin/activate`

But will look something like this

```bash
pip install simpletl
```

## Transformer Catalog
CSV - [X] 
[] - JSON
[] - Excel


## Integrations with SIMPETL

1. Jupyter Notebook Integration [] What does this mean? My idea is simple. After we run an ingest we then spawn a Jupyter Notebook with the dataframe already loaded and maybe a couple operations loaded into the notebook. 

1. Scheduler. Use case so lets say you want to run a specific ingest at 1523 every second monday of the month. Well you could set up a cron job to get this done. But this feels like it should be native to SimplETL.

1. UI. One day Ill get to a React Frontend Dashboard. Just not today...

1. Using Multiple databases (endpoints)

1. Web Scraping Module to ingest data from the web. 

1. Ip Rotation Service
